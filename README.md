Donation Portal: Secure mechanisms on both platforms for alumni to contribute donations easily and support various initiatives and projects undertaken by the college, fostering a culture of philanthropy. Networking Hub: Dedicated sections on both platforms to connect alumni based on shared interests, professions, and geographic locations, facilitating professional networking, mentorship, and collaboration opportunities. Job Portal: Integrated job search and posting features accessible via web and mobile apps, enabling alumni to explore career opportunities, post job openings, and connect with potential employers within the alumni network. Alumni Directory: Search functionalities available on both platforms to find alumni based on different criteria such as graduation year, field of study, industry, location, etc., promoting networking and community building. Success Story Tracking: Features on both web and mobile apps to showcase and track alumni achievements, success stories, and notable contributions to society, inspiring current students and fostering pride among alumni. Events and Reunions: Announcements, registrations, and management tools available on both platforms for organizing alumni events, reunions, workshops, and professional development sessions to maintain engagement and connection. Feedback and Surveys: Channels on both web and mobile apps for alumni to provide feedback on their experiences, suggest improvements, and participate in surveys to help shape future initiatives of the association. The platform will prioritize user experience, security, and scalability across both web and mobile applications to cater to the diverse needs of the Government Engineering College's alumni community. Expected Solution: Implementation of the Alumni Association platform for the Government Engineering College, comprising both web and mobile applications, is expected to achieve several positive outcomes: Enhanced Alumni Engagement: Seamless access to networking, career opportunities, and alumni events through web and mobile apps will strengthen connections among alumni, fostering a vibrant and active community. Increased Philanthropic Support: Convenient donation processes accessible via both platforms will encourage alumni to contribute towards the college's growth and development initiatives.

## Dependencies

Here are some things to know about network hub dependencies: Network project dependencies These are the relationships between tasks or activities that determine their order or timing. For example, you can't install a router until you have the cables and power supply. Network dependencies and parent/child relationships Network dependencies are often described as "parent/child" relationships, where the parent is the switch and the child is the server. Dependency network A dependency network is an internal data structure that can automatically recalculate property values based on changes to other property values. Leslie Graph A Leslie Graph is an abstraction that describes the dependencies between network, host, and application components. Intelligent hubs Intelligent hubs have software that allows them to detect and isolate network problems. This software can also help resolve issues with a device on the network. Hub A hub is a networking device that receives data signals from connected devices and broadcasts them to all other connected devices.
